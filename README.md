# For Arduino:
Make sure you have installed the Arduino Library 
```
EspMQTTClient
```
Change the Client Credentials to your own information (Make sure to pick a good client name!)
```
EspMQTTClient client(
 "ABB_Indgym_Guest",           // Wifi ssid                       CHANGE THIS
  "Welcome2abb",           // Wifi password                       CHANGE THIS
  "maqiatto.com",  // MQTT broker ip                              
  1883,             // MQTT broker port
  "william.johansson@abbindustrigymnasium.se", // MQTT username   CHANGE THIS
  "creativetalk",       // MQTT password                          CHANGE THIS
  "william1",          // Client name                             CHANGE THIS
  onConnectionEstablished, // Connection established callback
  true,             // Enable web updater
  true              // Enable debug messages
);

# MQTT
We recommend using the Internet broker MaQiaTTo, https://maqiatto.com .

Create an account, and your broker will be automatically created for you. Just follow the steps on the page
and you will get going right away.

To make the broker work with Node-MCU, use the Arduino-code and swap out the credentials for your own!
